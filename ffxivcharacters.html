    <h1>My characters from FFXIV</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Asch Faye</h2>
      <p> What started off as a male miqo'te alt in Kujata soon became my favourite character to play. Going through Shadowbringers on a SMN/DRK and experiencing the Eden and Nier raids when they were current, playing through Endwalker and ultimately moving to Materia's Zurvan (terrible idea, I know) before starting to do hardcore raids, Asch Faye really is my best character.</p>
      <p> She's gone through so many fantasias, too many that I can't even remember anymore. Somewhere over 20 times I'd bet. Either way, she's my main character now. I've completed the Abyssos Savage Raids, Anabaseios Savage Raids, and have currently beat both The Weapon's Refrain (Ultimate) and The Epic of Alexander (Ultimate) on her.</p>
      <p> What does the future hold for my dear Warrior of Light? Who knows. With the graphical update and frothgars on their way, I'd bet she'd fantas into one. Or maybe she'll stick to a bunny girl considering the graphical update might bring with it: wearable hats. Who knows. That's for the benchmark and the inevitable release of Dawntrail on 28/06/2024.</p>
      <p> Unfortunately, due to my prioritising extreme and savage content, I'm not caught up on MSQ. And that's where my alt comes in: Florian Castagnier.</p>

      <h2>Florian Castagnier (Ion)</h2>
      <p> Cute little hyur who made her way through A Realm Reborn and is on her way to progress through the Heavensward patches. That is, once I level up all of the Disciple of Hand/Land jobs. As you can tell from above, Florian is my dedicated story alt. This means <strong>NO SKIPPING CUTSCENES</strong> and doing everything I can on her.</p>
      <p> Now, unlike Asch, she's my keyboard character. I can't decide what job to main on her, but I have been enjoying NIN, RPR and BLM on keyboard, so I might stick to those.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Selh'teus Dawn???</h2>
      <p> So... there's this issue where I want to write reviews about everything in FFXIV. And, uhhh, while Florian has... wait, I just made Florian obsolete. Um. We'll figure this out another time, but Selh'teus will be my review alt.</p>
