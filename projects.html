  <h1>Projects!</h1>
  <p>So I like working on projects. Mostly Unity and Godot projects, sometimes a fanfic, sometimes a ren'py game. Regardless, they will all be stored under this little page. Maybe I'll give them their own dedicated categories when it gets that large. But for now, let's dance.</p>
