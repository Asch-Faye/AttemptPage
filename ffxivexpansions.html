    <h1>My thoughts and experiences with FFXIV's expansions</h1>
    <p>So, unfortunately, I never did experience every expansion at current. Nope. Only past Shadowbringers due to my age. So. Based off of what's available in Endwalker/Dawntrail, I will be reviewing every piece of content that I do while doing it with my Review Alt: Selh'Teus Dawn. Unfortunately, Asch Faye nor Florian Castagnier can participate in this as they have both progressed past the first MSQ, and they've done shit.</p>

      <h2>A Realm Reborn</h2>
      <p> The Origin of FFXIV 2.0 (sadly 1.0 is not available). In here I will cover: MSQ 2.0-2.55, Coils of Bahamut, Crystal Tower, Job Quests, Beast Tribes, and any other miscellaneous content.</p>
